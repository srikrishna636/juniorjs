# HTML Basics: Building the Skeleton of the Web! 🏗️

Welcome to HTML! Think of HTML as the **blueprint** of a house – it structures everything, but doesn't add colors or furniture (that's CSS and JS). 

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's like labeling parts of your toy box: 
- `<h1>` for big titles (like "My Awesome Toys! 🎉")
- `<p>` for paragraphs (descriptions).

Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World! 🌍</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page. It's like magic! ✨</p>
  </body>
</html>
